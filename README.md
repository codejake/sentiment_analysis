# sentiment_analysis

A largely vibe coded lunchtime project of little value, for Brxndon. It uses 
word lists and basic transformers. It's pretty slow because it's running off CPU 
and not GPU right now. It could be sped up considerably.

## Prerequisites

- Have Python 3.14 installed.
- Have `uv` installed.
- **Recommended:** Have Git installed.

## Install

- Clone this repo with git, or download it as a zip and unzip it somewhere.
- Open up Terminal and cd to the unzipped directory.
- Run `uv sync` in Terminal to download the project dependencies.
- Run `uv run main.py` to run it.

## Bugs

- There are a couple immediate bugs I need to fix in some future lunch session, 
  but it's good enough for a basic PoC.
- Fix the emotion categories. They suck and some are essentially duplicates.

Hit me up with questions.
