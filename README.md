# sentiment_analysis

A largely vibe coded lunchtime project of little value, for Brxndon.

## Prerequisites

- Have Python 3.14 installed.
- Have `uv` installed.

## Install

- Clone this repo with git, or download it as a zip and unzip it somewhere.
- Open up Terminal and cd to the unzipped directory.
- Run `uv sync` in Terminal to download the project dependencies.
- Run `uv run main.py` to run it.

## Bugs

- There are a couple immediate bugs I need to fix in some future lunch session.
- Fix the emotion categories. They suck and some are essentially duplicates.

Hit me up with questions.
