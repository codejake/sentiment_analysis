This project has a function that takes a news headline as a string as an argument.

It then attempts to determine the sentiment and emotion behind the headline and returns JSON with emotional scores.

Here are some of the emotions I want to check for:

- Optimism
- Pessimism
- Anger
- Hopeful
- Sad
- Fear
- Uncertainty
- Anxiety
- Confidence
- Urgency
